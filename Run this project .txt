Download the dataset from the following link:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fabiochiusano/medium-articles

When you have downloaded the dataset, if it is a zip/compressed file, unzip it.
Save the datset as Dataset.csv and keep it in the project directory

1)  run the divide.py so we have a chunk of the dataset
2)  run the clean.py : 
3)  run lexicon.py
4)  run forwardIndex.py
5)  run invertedIndex.py
6)  run query.py to seach now the search engine should have worked 

we had not implemeted barrels in this search engine yet so the speed may be slow but 
the results are very accurate
